# AI-image-generator-with-open-AI-api
AI image prompt generator website that will generate images from scratch based on the entered text
This project involves building an AI image generator using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Node.js. Users can provide a textual description of the image they want to generate, and the AI model will generate an image based on that input. A Node.js server will handle user requests, communicate with OpenAI's API, and enable users to save and download generated images. The AI model will be trained on a large dataset of images and fine-tuned to understand natural language input. A web interface will also be included for ease of use.
